# UW Oceanography Introduction to Environmental Monitoring and Technology (OCEAN 161)
Bathymetry lab acoustic sensor table top implementation for 100-level undergraduate course. This repository contains the StudentWorksheet.docx which walks you through the lab procedure to build, calibrate, and simulate use to map bathymetry at two different spatial resolutions. The lab acitivity uses the GraphingTemplate.xlsx so that students collect and input their data, the template graphs it automatically to make interpretation of the data more approachable. Instructors can use the LabSetup.docx to assemble the parts needed and create the table top bathymetry boxes required for the lab. The lab also requires a 3D holder for the acoustic sensor, SensorHolder.stl, to make measurements easier.
