This repository serves as a central location for the ultrasonic distance sensor Bathymetry Lab module and related activities for outreach, K-12, and undergraduate teaching. There are two sections to this repository, [**BathymetryLab**](https://github.com/publicsensors/BathymetryLab/tree/master/BathymetryLab) which contains the materials necessary to complete the seafloor activity, and [**AddOnsAndExtensions**](https://github.com/publicsensors/BathymetryLab/tree/master/AddOnsAndExtensions) which contains additional lab activities and code that can be used with the ultrasonic distance module.
